Tried only one question this day and somehow found it too difficult that it consumed my time of about 2 hours.
The two dishes question is still beyond my intelligence.
The textcases outputs are right but complexity is n^2 which is for I have been warned.
I think that it also consist of logic failure as well.
Need to thoroughly review it tommorrow.

here is the snippet:
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int T, N, S;
    cin >> T;
    for(int i = 0; i < T; i++)
    {
        cin >> N >> S;
        int maxdiff = 0;
        int diffmax;
        for(int i =0; i <= N; i++)
        {
            for(int j =0; j<=N; j++)
            {
                if(i+j == S)
                {
                    diffmax = max({maxdiff, abs(i-j)});
                    maxdiff = diffmax;
                }
            }
        }
        cout << diffmax << endl;
    }
	return 0;
}
